<p>Inline elements are used to markup text inside a block element like a paragraph or division.<br>Each element does different things to the text.<strong>This text is in a strong element.</strong><b>This text<break> is in a bold (B) element.</b>Bold and strong seem to have the same effect.<i>This is emphasised<break>(em) text.It seems to look the same as this italicized text here.</i><div>
Putting text inside quote elements,<q>like this quoted text here</q>,makes the text display with quotation marks around it.Code<code>code</code>tags 
 are meant for source code examples.They look like <code>code text here</code>.The keyboard element (kbd)looks the same,<kbd>keyboard text here</kbd>,but is meant for examples of user entered data.</div> 

<div>Superscript and subscript elements do what they say.<sup>this is superscript</sup> and <sub> this is subscript.</su></div> 
<div>
Span elements don't seem to do anything at all.I've put about every other inside span tags.
Can you tell which is which?</p></div>
