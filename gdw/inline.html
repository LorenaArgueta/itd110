<h1>Inline Elements</h1> 
<p>
Inline elements are used to markup text inside a block element
like a paragraph or division.<br>Each element does different things
to the text.<strong>This text is in a strong element.</strong>
This text <b>is in a bold (B) element.</b> Bold and strong seem
to have the same effect.<i>This is emphasised text.It seems to look
the same as this italicized text here.</i>
</p>

<div>
Putting text inside quote elements,<q>like this quoted text
here</q>,makes the text display with quotation marks around
it.Code<code>code</code>tags are meant for source code examples.They
look like <code>code text here</code>.The keyboard element (kbd)looks
the same,<kbd>keyboard text here</kbd>,but is meant for examples of
user entered data.
</div> 

<div>
Superscript and subscript elements do what they say.<sup>this is
superscript</sup> and <sub> this is subscript.</sub>
</div>

<div>
Span elements don't seem to do anything at all.I've put about every other inside span tags.
Can you tell which is which?
