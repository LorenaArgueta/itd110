<h2>purpose</h2>
<p>Don't be nervous when finding purpose finding your purpose.<br>
To simply be alive is just scratching the surface.<br>

As life goes on, you will find out the truth.<br>Blissful ignorance is only for the youth.<br>
As you get older, you start to wonder.<br>Why am I here? Was it just a blunder?<br>
Whatever your purpose, it is for you to choose,<br>because wasting your time wondering is of no use.</p>
